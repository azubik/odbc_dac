Open Database Connectivity (ODBC) is a widely accepted application programming
interface (API) for database access. It is based on the Call-Level Interface 
(CLI) specifications from X/Open and ISO/IEC for database APIs and uses 
Structured Query Language (SQL) as its database access language.

ODBC is designed for maximum interoperability-that is, the ability of a single 
application to access different database management systems (DBMSs) with the 
same source code. Database applications call functions in the ODBC interface, 
which are implemented in database-specific modules called drivers. The use of 
drivers isolates applications from database-specific calls in the same way that 
printer drivers isolate word processing programs from printer-specific commands. 
Because drivers are loaded at run time, a user only has to add a new driver to 
access a new DBMS; it is not necessary to recompile or relink the application.
